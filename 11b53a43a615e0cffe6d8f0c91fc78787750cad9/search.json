In December 2010 the Lato family was published under the Open Font License by his foundry tyPoland, with support from Google.          I do not think of type as something that should be readable. It should be beautiful.Ed Benguiat        In the last ten or so years, during which Łukasz has been designing type, most of his projects were rooted in a particular design task that he needed to solve. With Lato, it was no different. Originally, the family was conceived as a set of corporate fonts for a large client — who in the end decided to go in different stylistic direction, so the family became available for a public release.    When working on Lato, Łukasz tried to carefully balance some potentially conflicting priorities. He wanted to create a typeface that would seem quite “transparent” when used in body text but would display some original traits when used in larger sizes. He used classical proportions (particularly visible in the uppercase) to give the letterforms familiar harmony and elegance. At the same time, he created a sleek sans serif look, which makes evident the fact that Lato was designed in 2010 — even though it does not follow any current trend.    The semi-rounded details of the letters give Lato a feeling of warmth, while the strong structure provides stability and seriousness. “Male and female, serious but friendly. With the feeling of the Summer,” says Łukasz.

Volkhov was designed by Ivan Petrov.    Feeling Responsive uses Volkhov for…  &lt;h3&gt;          &lt;h1&gt;-headings      &lt;h2&gt;-headings      &lt;h3&gt;-headings      &lt;h4&gt;-headings      &lt;h5&gt;-headings      &lt;h6&gt;-headings        Heading in Volkhov &lt;h4&gt;    As a four-weight family it is well-suited for complex text environments being economic and legible, contemporary and prominent. Many of its design solutions relate to this purpose: large open counters, rather short descenders, and brutal asymmetric serifs.    Heading in Volkhov &lt;h5&gt;    Spacing in Bold is slightly increased compared to the normal weight, because the bold mass is mostly grown inwards. The Italic has a steep angle and a distinctive calligraphically reminiscent character, as a counterpart to the rigorous Regular.

Just strike through finished tasks.    &lt;cite&gt;    Albert Einstein    &lt;q&gt;    If you use &lt;q&gt; your text gets automagically quotes around the text passage.    &lt;dfn&gt;    The &lt;dfn&gt; tag is a phrase tag. It defines a definition term.    &lt;abbr&gt;    The WHO was founded in 1948.    &lt;time&gt;    The concert took place on May 15.    &lt;code&gt;    Some code: lucida console displayed.    &lt;var&gt;    The &lt;var&gt; tag is a phrase tag. It defines a variable.    &lt;samp&gt;    Text surrounded by &lt;samp&gt; looks like this in monospace.    &lt;kbd&gt;    Copycats enjoy pressing CMD + c and CMD + v.    &lt;sub&gt;    This text lays low and chills a bit.    &lt;sup&gt;    This text gets high above the clouds.    &lt;i&gt;    This looks italic.    &lt;b&gt;    This looks bold, too.    &lt;u&gt;    Underlining content for emphasize is not the best choice. You can't read it so well.    &lt;mark&gt;    Let’s mark this hint to give you a clue.    &lt;br&gt;    Need a break?

Use it in frontmatter for SEO purposes.  2015-04-28 // Version 1.2  Put some nice Schema.org-Meta-Data into the video-template for better SEO.

Added noindex-variable for search engine optimization (read more). Changed code for breadcrumb. Added Improve-Content-Include.  2015-02-19 // Version 0.99  Yes! Now Feeling Responsive uses the built-in sass-support by Jekyll. Open _sass and dig deeper into customizing this theme using your colors, typography and so on…  2015-02-18 // Version 0.98  Now with author-support and Schema.org microdata. Edit author(s) in authors.yml and use it via front matter like author: your_author_name. Added Disqus-comments to the mix.  2015-02-17 // Version 0.97  Simplicity. Reduced templates. Now there is one page/post-template with two switches via front matter to turn on metadata at the end of the page/post via show_meta: true/false and to add a left or right sidebar via sidebar: left/right. The defaults are declared in config.yml. I also changed the variable description to teaser because it’s more logigally.  2015-02-12 // Version 0.96  Added frontpage-layout with three widgets-areas. The layout simplifies the process to change content on the frontpage.  2015-02-09 // Version 0.95  Now with custom icon font using only entypo icons necessary.

Added foundation .scss-files to assets/scss/ for savety.  2014-10-08 // Version 0.91  Moved images folder from assets/img/ to images to fasten access to folder. Moved all pages to pages/-folder for better organization. Added language-functionality. Feeling Responsive is now translation ready.  2014-09-21 // Version 0.9  Optimized code, tweaked CSS, added images, deleted header: "no" from front matter (because it not necessary), added drafts to the new _drafts-folder to begin posts and pages faster and enhanced the documentation. Huh, 1.0 I am coming.  2014-09-16 // Version 0.8  Added video post format for that cinematic flavor. Added URL- and Credit-feature to images and revamped the homepage a little bit to give blog-content more exposure. Optimized some includes, especially the _include/list-posts.html-Include which support some nifty parameters.  2014-09-15 // Version 0.7  Added an example of a gallery to show how to use Clearing Lightbox. Meta information is used in posts via /include/meta_information.html. To optimize pages/posts for search engines you have now have an extra front matter-variable called meta_description.

Help improve it.			    Different Page/Posts Formats    Feeling Responsive supports you with different templates for your content. These are the actual page/post formats:    Page/Post    The page/post format has no sidebar by default, its content is centered and beneath the content the visitor gets some metadata like categories, tags, date and author if provided via data in front matter of the post.    use in front matter via: layout: page    Page/Post with a left or right sidebar    If you want to show the sidebar, just enter sidebar: left or sidebar: right in front matter, and whoops, there it is! To customize the content of the sidebar, open _includes/sidebar.html.    Page/Post with or without metadata    If you want to show metadata like categories, tags and date at the end of the page, just enter show_meta: true. It’s on by default. You can change it via config.yml. To turn of metadata just enter – yes, you guessed right – show_meta: false.    Page Full Width    If you want full control of styling a page, than use the page fullwidth template. To set up a grid, just use the foundation grid system.    use in front matter via: layout: page-fullwidth    Frontpage    This template is special. It allows you to define three widgets which are displayed with a headline, image, description and a link to the content. It’s used for the homepage of this website.    use in front matter via: layout: frontpage    Video    If you’re a video producer or cineast, you’ll like the video template. It darkens the layout to black and lets the video stand out full-width.    use in front matter via: layout: video    Up to table of contents    Style your content with    Feeling Responsive offers lots of possibilities to style your articles. You can style your content in different ways. There are elements like subheadlines, feature images, header images, homepage images, meta data like categories and tags and many more.    subheadlines    If you need a subheadline for an article, just define a subheadline in front matter like this:    subheadline:  "Subheadline"    Quotes    Quotes mix it up a little bit, if you write long articles. So use quotes:          Age is an issue of mind over matter. If you don’t mind, it doesn’t matter.Mark Twain        Up to table of contents    Comments    You can use comments with Feeling Responsive by the way of Disqus. If you want to use Disqus-Comments just open config.yml and add your disqus_shortname. More on how to use Disqus ›    By default comments are turned off. You can customize the default behaviour in config.yml. To turn on comments just add comments: true to front matter using the page layout layout: page.    Up to table of contents    Responsive Videos    With foundation responsive videos are easy. More ›                Code to use for flexible videos    &lt;div class="flex-video"&gt;  &lt;iframe with video /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;        Images: Title, Thumbnails, Homepage    There are several types of images you can define via front matter. If you want to change the images used in the header have a look at Style your Header.    Title Images    image:    title: image.jpg        Thumbnails    Thumbnails are used on archive pages like the blog index. They have a size of 150x150 pixels. Define them in front matter like this:    image:    thumb: thumbnail_image.jpg        Homepage Image    If you want to feature an article on the homepage with a huge image, than use the homepage image with a width of 970 pixels. If no homepage image is defined Feeling Responsive writes instead New Blog Articles over the blog entries. Define the homepage image like this:    image:    homepage: header_homepage_13.jpg        Captions with URL    Sometimes you want to give credit to the creator of your images, maybe with a link. Especially when you use Creative Commons-images like I do for this website. Just add the following front matter and Feeling Responsive does the rest:    image:    title: header_image.jpg    caption: Image by Phlow    caption_url: "http://phlow.de/"        Define all images for an article    image:    title: title_image.jpg    thumb: thumbnail_image.jpg    homepage: header_homepage_13.jpg    caption: Image by Phlow    caption_url: "http://phlow.de/"        Up to table of contents    Create a Table of Content    With the Kramdown parser for Markdown you can render a table of contents for your documents. Just insert the following HTML in your post before the actual content. More information on »Automatic ›Table of Contents‹ Generation«.    Bare Bones Version    ### Table of Contents*  Auto generated table of contents{:toc}    Foundation panel version    &lt;div class="panel radius" markdown="1"&gt;**Table of Contents**{: #toc }*  TOC{:toc}&lt;/div&gt;    Up to table of contents    Breadcrumbs    To turn on breadcrumbs, just use…    breadcrumb: true    Includes    Includes can be very helpful to spice up your content. You can use includes in your Markdown-files with ease: Just call them with some Liquid code.    list-posts.html    The list-posts.html-include is a loop to list posts. It’s a helper to add some additional content fast and easy. You can use it in individual posts for example. Which parameters you use, depends on you.    Possible parameter for the loop:          entries › define the number of entries to show      offset › define the offset (number of entries to skip before displaying the first one)      category › define only one category to display according entries        The loop looks when you use all parameters. Single parameters are possible of course.    {% include list-posts.html entries='3' offset='1' category='design' %}        next-previous-post-in-category.html    This include creates a next/previous link to a post of the same category using the first categories-variable in front matter.    {% include next-previous-post-in-category.html %}        improve_content.html    If your content is on Jekyll you can use this include to automatically generate a »Edit on GitHub Link« to give people a possibility to improve your content. Got the idea from Ben Balters Blog.    {% include improve_content.html %}        list-collection.html    This include lets you loop through a collection to list all entries in that collection. If you set »published: false« in front matter of a collection page the page gots filtered out via unless. The following example loops through a collection called wordpress.    {% include list-collection.html collection='wordpress' %}        alert – Embed an alert in your content    This include lets you easily display an alert. To use the include no .html ending is necessary. You can use five different kinds of alerts: warning, info, success, alert and text.    {% include alert warning='This is a warning.' %}{% include alert info='An info box.' %}{% include alert success='Yeah, you made it!' %}{% include alert alert='Danger!' %}{% include alert terminal='jekyll -serve' %}{% include alert text='Just a note!' %}        This is a warning.    An info box.    Yeah, you made it!    Danger!    jekyll -serve    Just a note!    You can even use &lt;html&gt;-tags inside the alert. Beware: Use “ and ‘ properly.    {% include alert info='&lt;em&gt;Feeling Responsive&lt;/em&gt; is listed on &lt;a href="http://jekyllthemes.org/"&gt;http://jekyllthemes.org&lt;/a&gt;' %}        Feeling Responsive is listed on http://jekyllthemes.org    Up to table of contents    Javascript/Foundation modules    Feeling Responsive uses the foundation framework and some of its javascript components. I reduced the modules, to decrease page load and make the theme faster.    I only added one other javascript-module: backstretch by Scott Robbin. These modules are currently used by the theme and included in javascript.min.js. There is also a non-minified version, if you want to take a closer look: javascript.js.    /foundation/bower_components/foundation/js/vendor/jquery.js'/foundation/bower_components/foundation/js/vendor/fastclick.js'/foundation/bower_components/foundation/js/foundation.accordion.js'/foundation/bower_components/foundation/js/foundation.clearing.js'/foundation/bower_components/foundation/js/foundation.dropdown.js'/foundation/bower_components/foundation/js/foundation.equalizer.js'/foundation/bower_components/foundation/js/foundation.magellan.js'/foundation/bower_components/foundation/js/foundation.topbar.js'/foundation/js/jquery.backstretch.js'        					Edit						This content is open source.
